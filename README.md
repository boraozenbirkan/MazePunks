# MazePunks
Maze Punks is a game for the Punk communities. And not just in one blockchain network, it is cross-network! All holders of Punks across all major blockchains can play the game and race to the center of the maze!

The development of the game is not finished because I learned about the game jam one day before the event day. As a solo developer, I couldnâ€™t finish it in one night. But I managed to make this demo **in one night.**

As a concept, I want to make something for a certain community. There can be other versions like for the Doge community. We can make the entrance with a ticket (too cheap) and pick the winner with a weekly lottery. Just for fun for the community

The project in its current position is not supporting actual Punk holders. It only supports a random collection for testing.

You can watch the demo **[here on YouTube!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCuocD2BGHc)**
